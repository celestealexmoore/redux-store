  ## Description
  This assignment involved refactoring an existing e-commerce platform so that it uses Redux.

  ## User-Story  
  `AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform  
  I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API  
  SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem`   

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  `GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state  
  WHEN I review the appâ€™s store  
  THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API  
  WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store  
  THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider  
  WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state  
  THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API  
  WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store  
  THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API  
  WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions  
  THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API`
